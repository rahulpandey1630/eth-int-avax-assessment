This workspace is organized to facilitate the development, deployment, and testing of the RailwayBooking smart contract.

Directory Structure
contracts: Contains the RailwayBooking contract.
scripts: Includes TypeScript files for deploying the RailwayBooking contract using web3.js and ethers.js.
tests: Contains test files for the RailwayBooking contract.
Scripts
The scripts folder has TypeScript files for deploying the RailwayBooking contract:

deploy_with_ethers.ts: Deploys the contract using ethers.js.
deploy_with_web3.ts: Deploys the contract using web3.js.
Update the contract name and constructor arguments in these files to deploy other contracts.

Tests
